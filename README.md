# DevOps-Applicants-Test


#### Test description

The following technical test consist of 4 deliverables to prove your basic knowledge on deployment artifacts and your current github skills for delivering the deliverables mentioned.
Don't be scare, we just want to measure your execution and mindset level of solving the following test.


#### Deliverables

The 4 deliverables will consist of:
- A `Dockerfile` with wordpress latest version
- A `docker-compose.yml` with a wordpress stack (`wordpress`, `mysql`, `nginx`) 
 It should be configured in a way that nginx can access wordpress, and wordpress has connection to the mysql database
- An `IP` with the `docker-compose.yml` wordpress stack running. (Use the cloud of your preference)
- A `kubernetes` yml pod specification with the wordpress stack with the same behaviour described with the `docker-compose.yml`


We only will receive the deliverables in this repo via PR request. You need to create a folder with your name in lowercase and separated by `_` and create an issue for each of the deliverables, being the third deliverable a README.md file with the IP of the wordpress stack. 


Feel free to ask any question to lowell@pokt.network


Happy coding!
